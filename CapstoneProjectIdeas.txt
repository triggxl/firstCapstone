Distracted Driving API/Maestro (Catalogs requests taken by user)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pitch:
Mitigates distractions, allowing the user to only engage in driving related tasks
and be more attentive of their surroundings; helps to exercise self-control and discipline to
be more at ease during their commute and appreciative of other drivers; be more diligent; not so rushed/apprehensive;

Overview:
•API that forwards all notifications to DND (do not disturb mode), enabling hands-free calling only
•Basic Functionality: feature will be enabled once engine is started, and vehicle is switched from park to drive; 
•app will pair with ECU Chip (newer) or crack sensor (older) ref: https://www.quora.com/What-sensors-are-used-to-detect-when-a-car-is-running
other terms to consider: image processing algorithms, car engine sensors, in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) system with smartphone integration
(**perhaps a pair API to a hub/port/brick can be created to allow smartphone integration to enable app features in all vehicles**)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
•notifications will only become available once the engine is turned off OR
car has been in park for >= 5 seconds
"Any notifications during your trip will be available once your trip has ended;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General Syntax:

const url;
const apiKey;


const getData = () => {
  //fetch
  //then
  //catch
}

const displayResults = () => {

}

const whileDriving = () => {
  Would you like to enable a complimentary 'away message' during this trip?
  ex: users will be notified when they try to reach you, that you are currently 'on the road again..'
  (come up with witty phrases to augment utility value for the user)
}

--> if endOfTrip () {
  Would you like to enable notifications?
  please place the vehicle in park. you're notifications will display shortly..
}

const myCatalog = () => {
  tasks, reminders, notifications, 'food for thought', ideas, revelations etc (keep in local storage until cataloged??)
}

const watchForm = () => {

}

*API systems to communicate with: (newer, older)*
1. connect/pairs with infotainment systems (IVI), ECU Chip (Start with current vehicle, Hyundai)
2. Older:
 •connect/pairs with Bluetooth Receiver ex: FM transmitter/**Dedicated Bluetooth Speaker Phone (clips to sunvisor)
...

3. IO_CAPABILITY_IO: Device has a display and can accept basic (yes/no) input. (Languages: Kotlin, Java)
https://developer.android.com/things/sdk/apis/bluetooth#java
(All in all I can create a browser based API that carries out these features, --> write it in different languages later)

Gist:
•Having trouble finding the API docs to communicate with
•I'm wanting to create an API that pairs with the Bluetooth component vehicle/phone/streaming assistant to enter DND mode while driving
I just need to figure out how to work with EverDrive's API platform

Dedicated Bluetooth Speaker Phone's API documentation, Google Assistant

Goal is to suppress visual distractions, optimize coordination/travel time/user experience on the road;to greatly improve the safety and experience 

DND mode enabling (Do Not Disturb)

•Application Provided vs. Preloaded DND rules

•export and list custom DND rules

-The Android settings UI presents user options for suppressing visual distractions such as heads up notifications, 
fullscreen intents, ambient display, and LED notification lights.

•link to reward system for choosing to develop safer driving habits (ref: EverDrive, State Farm/Progressive Insurance)
ex: 2x fuel perks for ex: the current Month

•look at do not disturb mode API docs
•look into API docs of other task management applications (ex: Evernote, Android Auto)

•includes a feature that allows the user to save 'footnotes' throughout their trip (stored in 'Footnotes' file, local storage)
(API functionality similar to Alexa or other iOT's)

• "maestro" feature to help driver engage in safer/more effective driving habits +
stay up to date with driving protocols

What is meant by EMI and EMC?
While electromagnetic interference (EMI) is a phenomenon - the radiation emitted and its effects - 
electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) is an equipment characteristic or property - not to behave unacceptably in the EMI environment.

ECU
Every modern car now has an engine chip, which is part of the ECU (electronic control unit), 
that monitors how much fuel and air goes into the engine as well as the exhaust gases that come out the other end. 
The main job of the ECU and its chip is to balance power performance with economy and emissions.

Immobilizer Systems (use to prevent hot wiring or motor theft)
"transponder sends a signals the corresponds with a set of unique codes to compare to ones stored in memory. If match is found --> okay to start message through the BCM to the ECM"

What problem does your idea address?
The problem is, that we don't always have time to physically write something down when we're on the road. We don't really even have time to open an app to capture a thought either. With Memor-ago, it would be a hands-free device that is personalized to you.

Memor-ago
Life is full of moments that we least expect. Why not capture them?
How does your idea solve this problem?
The device would clip onto a visor or air vent, and as you think of something you need to jot down, "Memor-ago" will 
do the rest. Set a greeting for your "Memor-ago" to turn on and your voice will be heard. 
Instantly upload a famous saying to Facebook, or choose to save your thought under a new titled folder for later recollection. 
This product would significantly increase productivity on the road, as well as make our roads safer.
